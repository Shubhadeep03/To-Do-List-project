Here's a sample description you can add to the "About Me" section regarding the To-Do List project:

To-Do List Application:
This project is a simple and responsive to-do list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to:

Add tasks: Users can add tasks to the list with ease.
Mark tasks as complete: Users can check off tasks once completed.
Remove tasks: Users can delete tasks that are no longer needed.
Data Persistence: The app stores tasks locally using the browserâ€™s local storage, ensuring tasks remain even after the page is refreshed.
This project demonstrates my ability to handle core web development tasks, including DOM manipulation, local storage management, and responsive design.
